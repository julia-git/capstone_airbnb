# I Just Want To Be Popular...On Airbnb


## Overview
I Just Want To Be Popular is a data science project on predicting popularity of Airbnb listings in San Francisco in 2017. Will a listing be in the top 20 percent?
The proxy for popularity is "reviews per month".


## Motivation
Airbnb hosts want their listings to be popular to increase the number of bookings they receive and therefore increase profits. 
This project serves to extend some answer to what hosts should do to become more popular.
