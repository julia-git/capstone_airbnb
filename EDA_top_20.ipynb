      "There's one word that fully encompasses the experience of staying at our hostel: Community. At first glance, one might presume that the endgame of all hostels is to create a sense of firm familiarity among guest and staff alike, but with us, you can feel it. With a full roster of events that are ongoing, all inclusive in both experience and price, and a design purposefully conducive to the gathering of folks all around the world, we are dedicated to establishing a world reaching community that you feel while you are here, and long after your stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur adventure travel company launched in 1974 with the purpose of bringing together folks who share the same single ambition: Travel! For the next twenty years, our buses brought these wandering souls to experience places as close as Santa Barbara and Monterey, to destinations as far as Alaska, New York City, and even Costa Rica. As incredible as these destinations are, we believe it is more about the journey than the destination.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990’s we opened our San Francisco hostel to offer a haven for travelers to settle, rest, and of course party! In opening our hostel, we hoped to create a sense of community and create a haven where these newly found friendships would flourish.  We believe that bringing people together to create a community is the true purpose of a hostel.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity. That’s what we’re about.  Stop by and experience it for yourself. \\r\\n    474\n",

I moved to the US in 2007 to study Finance and Accounting while playing tennis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI met Lele while directing a summer camp for international student-athletes at Stanford University.

      "I'm a native Chicagoan and current San Franciscan. I work for a travel website (you've probably heard of it) and one of the best things about it is that it allows me to visit new places. I am adept at making homemade espresso and deep dish pizza. I'm a Libra, INTJ, and a rabbit if you're into that stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

If you prefer to arrive/leave during my work hours, I will give you clear instructions to enter the condo and check you in remotely. >>>> Please indicate your expected time of checkin and checkout along with your reservation request <<<< Depending on if you want company or privacy, I would be happy to share more about the city, give you tips about things to do and even show you surrounding neighborhoods if you like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

Just press       the button on the gate which then we will buzz you in. Come inside and       we will check you in. 5. Our hotel is centrally located to everything you could possibly think of       however there is a church/shelter a block away which gets the sidewalk       filled with homeless people but there are streets you can take to avoid       them. 6.

Any day of the week, the Upper Haight is filled with a potent mix of locals and tourists. Many shops are geared towards luring visitors with some kind of reflection of the neighborhood's storied past. The carnival-like energy and strong vintage atmosphere comes through everywhere, from the clothing shops to the ornate Victorian architecture. Less touristy and more low-key than the Upper Haight, this is an eclectic alternative to the Mission, very similar in style. The diverse restaurants, shops and salons cater to residents more than visitors. Walking distance to tennis courts located in a beautiful park. The park is also great for jogging and evening walks. Yoga and massage studios are nearby. Moreover, walking distance to shopping in the lively Haight-Ashbury and Castro neighborhoods.

      "North Beach is where the Italian immigrants first settled upon migrating westward from Europe and the East Coast, both during the Gold Rush and in the early part of the 19th and 20th centuries. Much of North Beach has retained the old-world feel of the late 1800s and early 1900s, and you'll still hear Italian being spoken on the streets and in the many cafes that dot the area. Some of the best food in the city, Italian or otherwise, can be found in North Beach. With Chinatown right next door, you've got two continents easily represented for culinary delights. The city has dutifully limited the amount of chain establishments that can take residence in North Beach, so you're sure to sample only genuine fare while here.

However, it does offer a microwave, mini-fridge, Keurig coffee maker and tea cooker.

The 1/2 bath with toilet and sink are private and located just outside the room.  The price reflects what you get.  There are two basic and very clean rooms which together can accommodate up to 8 people. With 8 it is very crowded and there is no personal space. It is recommended to have 6 people or less. If  you have small children in the bunk beds you will be fine with 8 people. I do not recommend 8 adults.
